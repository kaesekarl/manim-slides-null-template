# Documentation for Manim-Slides-Framework
**Author:** Kaesekarl  
This is a framework for creating slides with Manim. It uses the [manim CE library ](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/) 
to render the Animations and Slides. 
It also uses the [manim-slides](https://github.com/jeertmans/manim-slides) library to create the Presentation itself.
The Design is heavily influenced by [karlosos LaTeX-Beamer Template](https://github.com/karlosos/zut-fibeamer).

## Installation
Please follow the instructions for Manim and Manim-Slides. This framework comes with pipenv-files, so you can use 
pipenv to install the dependencies.

Then you just need the `layouts.py`, `layouts_elements.py`, `newcolors.py` and `constants.py` files from this repository.


## Usage
You can use the functions returning templates from `layouts.py` to create your slides. You can also use the functions 
from `layouts_elements.py` to create new templates.
